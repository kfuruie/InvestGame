# InvestIt


__Phase 4 TODO__

- ICA 6 & ICA 11 seem the most relevant
   - We'll probably also have do the PHP Session integration with Angular
- Integrate Angular with our current architecture 
- Can probably use Angular specifically for our "Shopping Cart"/tradingCenter
   - ~~Create a bunch of sample investments as part of an Angular Component, use ngFor to iterate through them and list them~~
   - Use ngIf to show a helper message when no items have been selected
      - If items have been selected, the ngIf will show the total value of the shares * the price of the investment

__Angular Implementation__ (58 points)

- ~~(14 points) Correctly implement at least one component~~
- ~~(10 points) Correctly use at least two out of three common, built-in structural directives (5 points each)~~
   - ~~ngIf~~
   - ~~ngFor~~
   - ~~ngSwitch (and ngSwitchCase and ngSwitchDefault -- count as one use of structural directives)~~
- ~~(5 points) — Correctly use built-in attribute directive ngStyle, [ngStyle], or [style] to set at least one CSS property~~
- ~~(5 points) — Correctly use built-in attribute directive ngClass, [ngClass], or [class] to set at least one CSS class~~
- ~~(10 points) Correctly use (or implement) at least two categories of data binding (5 points each). Implementing two of the same category does not satisfy this requirement.~~
   - ~~One-way binding from component to DOM~~
   - ~~One-way binding from DOM to component, "event binding"~~
   - ~~Two-way binding~~
- (14 points) Correctly interact with at least one server-side component
